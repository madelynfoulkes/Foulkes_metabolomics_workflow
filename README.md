This code encompasses both final figures and supplemental figures used in the data visualizations in the project "How Competitive Success Is Determined between Heterotrophic Bacteria in the Algal Phycosphere?: A Metabolomic Analysis of an Established Engineered Microbiome". In this paper are all citations for packages used and the accompanying analyses for all of the figures.

The goal of this project was to apply untargeted metabolomic analysis to an extablished model microbiome created by Dr. Jinny Yang. These workflows work well for individuals working with large metabolomic datasets in the field of ecology or microbiology. 


I have provided the code on how to make basic but visually pleasing facet wrapped growth curves, scaled and organized heatmaps, and PCoA ordinations for very large datasets (over 200 observations)
